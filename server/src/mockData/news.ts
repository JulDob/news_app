      "<h1>Independence Day of Ukraine</h1><br> Independence Day of Ukraine (Ukrainian: День незалежності України) is the main state holiday in modern Ukraine, celebrated on 24 August in commemoration of the Declaration of Independence of 1991.<br>History of Ukrainian Independence Day <br>The start of the 1990s saw the collapse of the Soviet Union. On July 16th 1990, the Ukrainian government had declared state sovereignty. July 16th was celebrated as Independence Day one year later.<br>In August 1991, there was a failed coup to restore the communist rule in the Soviet Union. As a result of the attempted coup and increasing fears about a return to Soviet rule, the people’s deputies brought the Ukrainian flag into the session hall of the Verkhovna Rada.<br>On August 24th, the Act of Independence of Ukraine was adopted by the Ukrainian parliament, and a yellow and blue flag appeared on the building of the Verkhovna Rada.<br>The blue-yellow colour of the Ukrainian flag has a deep historical tradition. During the 20th century, it became the national flag of the Ukrainian People's Republic between 1917 and 1920. It was banned under the Soviet regime it was banned becoming a symbol of the independence movement.A condition of the declaration was that a national referendum should take place on December 1st 1991. Despite outside concerns that Ukraine could split into east and west, the turnout was over 80% and the result of the referendum was that over 92% voted in favour of their independence.<br>In June 1992, Parliament voted for an amendment to the legislative framework, according to which July 16th was officially replaced by August 24th as Ukraine's Independence Day.<br>![Holliday](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66001333/168763031-d00b701c-917a-4393-9209-61073ec1d305.jpg)<br>For some, the referendum of December 1st is seen as a more important date than the declaration of independence as it showed Ukraine's unity in wanting independence.<br>Did you know?<br>The main official events take place in Kyiv. The Ukrainian President will give a speech to mark the occasion; state leaders lay flowers at the monuments of famous Ukrainians and join the prayer for Ukraine that is traditionally performed at St.Sophia's Church in Kyiv, with members of all the Christian Churches present at the ceremony.",

      "<h1> Do you feel like you need help and don’t know where to turn?</h1><br>Do you feel like you need help and don’t know where to turn? If you’ve hit the point of wanting to ask for help or the thought “Please help me” keeps running through your mind, it’s likely that you’ve hit some sort of a crisis point in your life and don’t know how to deal with your situation.<br>You probably know something is wrong in your life, but feel as though you need advice or direction to put you at ease and give you hope that your problem can be solved. If this is the situation that you are in, know that there are steps you can take to get the help that you need and to start feeling better.<h2>What Are You Feeling?</h2><br>If you keep thinking “Please help me,” the first step is to ask yourself exactly what you are experiencing in the moment. What feelings or thoughts are coming up that have left you feeling this way?<br>If you can get clear about the emotions you are experiencing, then it will be easier to explain to others what you are going through. In turn, this will make it easier for others to be able to help you or give you direction.<br>Here are some possible painful and challenging emotions that you might be experiencing that have left you feeling as though you need help from someone:<br>If you aren’t exactly sure what you are feeling, try writing in a journal about what’s going on that has left you feeling this way. Try not to overthink it and just write as things come to you.![Help](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66001333/168762302-dc08706a-4f5c-4429-b4a8-dc9773cd6445.jpg)    Keep writing until you dig deep enough to get at the emotions that you are experiencing or how you have been feeling about what’s going on. Once you have a better idea of your emotions, you'll be able to describe them to someone else when you ask for help.<h2>What Is Wrong?</h2>Beyond being able to articulate the emotions that you are experiencing, it might also be helpful to be able to describe to someone what has caused you to feel this way. While you might not always be aware of the reasons for how you are feeling, other times there might be a clear trigger or situation that is causing you concern.",

      "<h1>The Walt Disney Concert Hall</h1>The Walt Disney Concert Hall at 111 South Grand Avenue in downtown Los Angeles, California, is the fourth hall of the Los Angeles Music Center and was designed by Frank Gehry. It was opened on October 24, 2003. Bounded by Hope Street, Grand Avenue, and 1st and 2nd Streets, it seats 2,265 people and serves, among other purposes, as the home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestra and the Los Angeles Master Chorale. The hall is a compromise between a vineyard-style seating configuration, like the Berliner Philharmonie by Hans Scharoun, and a classical shoebox design like the Vienna Musikverein or the Boston Symphony Hall.<br>Lillian Disney made an initial gift of $50 million in 1987 to build a performance venue as a gift to the people of Los Angeles and a tribute to Walt Disney's devotion to the arts and to the city. Both Gehry's architecture and the acoustics of the concert hall, designed by Minoru Nagata, the final completion supervised by Nagata's assistant and protege Yasuhisa Toyota, have been praised, in contrast to its predecessor, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.<br>The project was initiated in 1987, when Lillian Disney, widow of Walt Disney, donated $50 million. Frank Gehry delivered completed designs in 1991. Construction of the underground parking garage began in 1992 and was completed in 1996. The garage cost had been $110 million, and was paid for by Los Angeles County, which sold bonds to provide the garage under the site of the planned hall. Construction of the concert hall itself stalled from 1994 to 1996 due to lack of fundraising. Additional funds were required since the construction cost of the final project far exceeded the original budget. Plans were revised, and in a cost-saving move the originally designed stone exterior was replaced with a less costly stainless steel skin.: 114  The needed fundraising restarted in earnest in 1996, headed by Eli Broad and then-mayor Richard Riordan. Groundbreaking for the hall was held in December 1999. Delay in the project completion caused many financial problems for the county of LA. The County expected to repay the garage debts by revenue coming from the Disney Hall parking users.<br>![The Walt Disney Concert Hall](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66001333/168760584-eba8399f-aae3-4430-8f32-370e2bdda1c8.jpg)<br>Upon completion in 2003, the project cost an estimated $274 million; the parking garage alone cost $110 million. The remainder of the total cost was paid by private donations, of which the Disney family's contribution was estimated to $84.5 million with another $25 million from The Walt Disney Company. By comparison, the three existing halls of the Music Center cost $35 million in the 1960s (about $330 million in 2021 dollars).<br> The hall met with laudatory approval from nearly all of its listeners, including its performers. In an interview with PBS, Esa-Pekka Salonen, former Music Director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, said, 'The sound, of course, was my greatest concern, but now I am totally happy, and so is the orchestra,' and later said, 'Everyone can now hear what the L.A. Phil is supposed to sound like.'This remains one of the most successful grand openings of a concert hall in American history.[citation needed]<br>The walls and ceiling of the hall are finished with Douglas-fir while the floor is finished with oak. Columbia Showcase & Cabinet Co. Inc., based in Sun Valley, CA, produced all of the ceiling panels, wall panels and architectural woodwork for the main auditorium and lobbies. The Hall's reverberation time is approximately 2.2 seconds unoccupied and 2.0 seconds occupied.",
